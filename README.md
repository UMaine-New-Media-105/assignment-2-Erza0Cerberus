Abstract Shape

For this part of the assignment we were asked to create an abstract shape and using mainly ellipses and few other shapes I created a shape that resembles the character sonic the hedgehog.
I also was able to use the if + mouseispressed statements to make it so when you press your mouse over the shape some parts change colors!

Custom Flag

For this assignment we were told to take 2 or more flags that start with the first letter of our first and last name (Mine being Cerberus Curry so C+C
So I chose the Chinese flag along with the flag of Côte d'Ivoire and combined them in a simple way to create my own custom flag
I used the main colors of the Côte d'Ivoire flag but changed the orange to red and added one big yellow star in the middle of the entire flag to mix in the Chinese flag

Repostionable Shape

For this assignment we were to take our abstract shape and reposition it to the top left corner of the sketch. And I got a little bit mixed up with this one and ended up editing the original abstract shape to fit this assignment though it is still the same abstract shape.
Using push and pop along with translate and scale I was able to reposition my shape to the top left corner along with making it smaller in size.

Gridded Initals with a function

This assignment we were asked to recreate our gridded initals but doing so with a function.
Using my original gridded inital assignment I was able to easily take the original code and edit it so that instead of writting out each individual number I used the let function along with custom variables to grid out my code instead.
