Abstract Shape

For this part of the assignment we were asked to create an abstract shape and using mainly ellipses and few other shapes I created a shape that resembles the character sonic the hedgehog.
I also was able to use the if + mouseispressed statements to make it so when you press your mouse over the shape some parts change colors!
